# Shy60-Rev.2
This is a modified bakeneko60, to be a two piece case, with a external weight. It has also removed the gummy Oring mount, the bakeneko60 was known for and added a gasket mount, with gummy Orings laying underneath the plate. There will be no gaskets over the plate.

Case desig:

Mounting(has been tested on the Shy60 Rev.1):

This Mounting result into a typing experience, which is more on the stiffer side, with a soft bottom out and a little amount of bounce.
The Sound of this Mounting will be more on the deeper side.

Plate Layout support:

This Layout only has support for the Tsangan botton row, since I prefer it more over than the 6,25 space bar.

What is requiered to make this Keyboard (Attention!: I have not tested this keyboard yet, so if you want to make this keyboard yourself, you have to make it on you own risk):
 -5x   M2,5x8mm  round or socket screws
 -3x   M3x3-4mm countersunk screws
 -1x   2m long x 4mm thick Oring
 -1x   Waffling60 PCB(bakeneko version)[or any other PCB, which is compatible with the open source V3 bakeneko]
 -1x   Ai03 unified daughterboard, with a 15cm long JST connector
 
 I hope you will like this keyboard, but keep in mind, that I have not tested it yet, I just wantad to share this project, to demonstrate the mounting.
